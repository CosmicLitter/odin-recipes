    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, not to be confused with oat bar flapjacks) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>100g plain flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>300ml milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.</li>
        <li>Set a medium frying pan or crÃªpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, keeping them warm in a low oven as you go.</li>
        <li>Serve with lemon wedges and sugar, or your favourite filling. Once cold, you can layer the pancakes between baking parchment, then wrap in cling film and freeze for up to 2 months.</li>
    </ol>
