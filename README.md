# HTML Learning Goals

This repository contains my progress in learning basic HTML through the Odin Project: (https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goals of this project are to:

1. **Understand the Structure**: Learn the fundamental structure of an HTML document, including the `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

2. **Master HTML Tags**: Gain a solid understanding of essential HTML tags such as `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<a>` for links, `<img>` for images, `<ul>` and `<ol>` for lists, `<div>` and `<span>` for containers, and more.

3. **Create Forms**: Learn how to build HTML forms using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and other form elements. Explore different input types, form validation, and handling form submission.

4. **Apply Semantic Markup**: Understand the importance of semantic markup and how to use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc., to improve the accessibility and structure of web content.

5. **Incorporate Multimedia**: Explore the integration of multimedia elements such as images, videos, and audio using appropriate HTML tags.

6. **Understand Hyperlinks**: Learn how to create hyperlinks within the HTML document and to external websites. Understand the various attributes of `<a>` tags, including `href`, `target`, and `rel`.

7. **Practice HTML5 Features**: Get familiar with new HTML5 features and elements like `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<canvas>`, `<svg>`, and more, to enhance the user experience and interactivity of web pages.

8. **Improve Accessibility**: Focus on making web content more accessible by utilizing appropriate HTML elements, ALT attributes for images, and providing text alternatives for non-text content.
